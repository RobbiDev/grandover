# üëã About

Created on October 2022, I started to work on a full-stack application designed specifically to enhance the operations of Chick-Fil-A at Grandover Village. The primary objective of this project is to improve efficiency, simplify processes, and provide seamless support for the day-to-day activities at the restaurant. By harnessing the power of modern technology, The "Grandover Project" aims to revolutionize the way Chick-Fil-A operates, making it a smoother and more streamlined experience for both staff and customers alike

**NOTE:** This project will be open-sourced in the future, but as of right now. This repo will be used to show off and showcase my work done with [Chick-Fil-A Properties, Inc.](https://www.chick-fil-a.com/)

# üîí Security & Login

The "Grandover Project" starts all at the login page. Strictly being only access by leaders of the store. No others have access which protect company and employee infomation. The Application places a strong emphasis on security and login protocols to ensure the protection of sensitive data and maintain a trusted environment.

## Password Management:

The process of adding and creating user accounts is exclusively performed by the operator account, maintaining strict control over the creation of new user credentials. Once an account is created, the username and password are predetermined by the operator, ensuring a standardized and secure approach to account creation.

## User Roles and Access Permissions:

The "Grandover Project" employs a robust user role management system, allowing administrators to assign specific roles and access permissions to different users. This ensures that individuals only have access to the features and data that are relevant to their responsibilities, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental data exposure.
